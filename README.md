#Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection

Classifying and localizing 14 types of lung diseases with YOLO

The chest X-ray abnormalities detection is a machine learning competition featured on Kaggle by VINAI, which ended in March 2021 [1]. In this competition, participants will have to automatically classify and localize 14 types of thoracic abnormalities from chest radiographs. The dataset consists of 18,000 chest scans (DICOM format) that have been annotated by experience radiologists. The dataset has been divided into 15,000 independently labeled training images and 3,000 test images. These annotations were collected via a web-based platform, Vinlab. Details on building this dataset can be found in this paper [2]. The 14 critical radiographic findings are: 0 – Aortic enlargement, 1 – Atelectasis, 2 – Calcification, 3 – Cardiomegaly, 4 – Consolidation, 5 – ILD, 6 – Infiltration, 7 – Lung Opacity, 8 – Nodule/Mass, 9 – Other lesion, 10 – Pleural effusion, 11 - Pleural thickening, 12 – Pneumothorax, 13 – Pulmonary fibrosis. There is also another class 14 for “No finding”. The training files also have a train.csv file that contains trainset metadata, with one row for each object with columns such as unique image identifier: image_id, the name of the class of detected object: class_name, the ID of the class of detected object: class_id, rad_id, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max.
